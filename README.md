This web app allows users to track their online chess games and visualize statistics.
By tracking wins and losses along with marking why each game was lost, users can figure out
what they need to work on to improve their chess game.

# To Use

1. Create an account.
2. Add completed chess games under the tab My Games
    - If you lose a game, use the checkboxes to mark why
4. Under my dashboard you can visualize the data
5. The percentages are used to display what you need to work on to improve your game
     - the higher the number, the greater the emphasis

** Important Note: The app will become more accurate with each game you log
